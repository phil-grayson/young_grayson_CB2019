- PIQ took a lot of troubleshooting to run on the Odyssey cluster at Harvard.  Please feel free to email me at phil.grayson@umanitoba.ca if you would like to discuss how I installed and ran PIQ for this dataset.
- following the PIQ run, calls.Master.csv was generated by concatenating all footprint calls from the "calls.csv" results files across all datasets. this file can be found in the ATAC GEO package for this manuscript
- I did not have much luck opening the 45 Gb file in R for filtering, and so, for the Sall-1 promixal peak (the only one we used the PIQ data for), the first step was to simply grep the correct scaffolds from chicken and emu from that master file and then this was read into the R script
grep "NC_006098.3" calls.Master.csv > chick_SALL1_chrom.csv
grep "scaffold_25" calls.Master.csv > emu_SALL1_chrom.csv
